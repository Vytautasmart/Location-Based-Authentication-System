# Location Based Authentication


## TODO:

### 1. Connect to the database and send the payload:
- Uncomment the database logic in `routes/users.js`.
- Ensure the database connection is working correctly.
- Send the username and password from the login form to the database.
- Return a success message to the client.

### 2. Future Development:
- Implement JWT for session management.
- Explore OAuth for additional authentication features.
- Design the main application page, including a QR code scanner for the mobile version.
- Build the front-end registration page using React Native for the mobile application.
- Investigate and integrate the Google Location API.

**Note:** These tasks should be broken down into smaller, manageable steps.
